    <p>
      Emily discovered the guitar at the age of 15 and never looked back. Before
      long she was entering a world of songwriting, music production, video
      editing and trying her hand at more instruments than you can shake a stick
      at.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some years on and she now has{' '}
      <TextLink href="https://emilyfoxmusic.bandcamp.com">
        three self-produced albums
      </TextLink>{' '}
      under her belt,{' '}
      <TextLink href="https://https://www.youtube.com/user/foxxemusic">
        over 100 YouTube videos
      </TextLink>{' '}
      on her channel, and even a performance at the Royal Albert Hall to her
      name.
    </p>

      By day Emily is a software developer/tech lead for a UK-based software
      company.
